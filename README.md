## Description
My first attempt at making a robotic actuator which kind of works, but too fast. Instead, I should have used motors with lower speed and higher torque.
More design improvements and changes are coming someday!

## What files to use
V2 as it is easier to assemble and requires a couple of M4 screws and nuts

## How to make
Print on normal slicer settings, I used Cura. Use RAFT! PLA is fine.

If you want to try V1 you will need 4 4mm in diameter steel rods cut to the length of 23mm.
